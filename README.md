Github repos seeking designers with GSOW (Good sense of white-space) for friendship, forking, maybe more

## The background

I've often wanted to contribute design or HTML/CSS to an open source project but have struggled to find repos where thats being sought. After watching [@nrrrdcore](https://github.com/nrrrdcore) give an amazing talk at [HybridConf](http://hybridconf.net) I decided to build something to help put repo owners in touch with designers.

## Usage 

Its all run from a [public googledoc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuP7bQyTwVeFdEp0OTV5WUxQZ2x3aWNOOEtfSGRhWlE&usp=sharing) via the magic of [sheetsee.js](http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/) by [@jlord](https://github.com/jlord).

To add your repo to the list, just create a new line on the googledoc, taking care to format the details in the same way. Newest repos will be at the top of the list.

## To dos

- Make it look nice
- Add some searching and filtering
- Use a google form to submit a new repo
- Set up a twitter account for it
- Use IFTT to auto tweet when a new repo is added
